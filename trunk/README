private-feeds
=============

What's needed
-------------

* a webhost with Perl support
* .htaccess support
* Crypt::SSLeay (for SSL support), LWP, CGI and YAML Perl modules


Usage
-----

* put feeds.yaml and private-feeds to your cgi-bin/ directory
* generate a UUID (whatever kind, just unique enough not to get guessed by people)
* put this UUID together with your feed URLs (including username and password) into feeds.yaml
* IMPORTANT: put the following into your .htaccess

<Files feeds.yaml>
        deny from all
</Files>

and make sure that you can't access feeds.yaml from outside.

* now try to call the script with your UUID as parameter, e.g. http://your-web-site.com/cgi-bin/private-feeds?f8ce7af7-598f-4e04-9c6f-de0b261748d3 You should now see the contents of the password-protected page associated with this UUID. 

TODO
----

* YAML is actually overkill, throw it out
